# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my profile! I'm Rob, a mathematics graduate who enjoys working with data. My current stack for analysis is Python, SQL (MySQL), and Tableau.

In my portfolio you'll find my projects on data analytics. I've also got some examples of work from my undergraduate Statistical Learning module which served as a mathematical introduction to machine learning, and focused on implementing these ideas in Python. 

### My Skills
- Data preparation and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis

### My Tools
- Databases: SQL (MySQL), Excel
- Python: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn
- Visualisation: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- UFC Analysis in SQL: Designing a database for a UFC dataset from Kaggle. Once the database is designed and filled I will be analysing fighters and events.

- Mental Health in Tech Tableau Visualisation: Building and developing an interactive dashboard for the results of the OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey 2016.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

- Foundations of database design
- Advanced SQL query techniques such as aggregation, nested queries, and window functions
